# Customer Transaction Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I am going to analyze credit card transactions done by customers in India. for this, I fetched the data from Kaggle. The purpose of this project is to utilize my SQL skill in playing with data and finding insight that can be used to make Business decision.

## Data Exploration

In this dataset, it contains 26K+ rows and there are 7 columns: transaction_id, city, transaction_date, card_type, exp_type, gender and amount. here i ensured the data quality by confirming whether Null is present or not and same fro duplicate rows. this data set has transaction_id as its primary key.
this dataset contains the transaction data from 2013-10 to 2015-05 done via credit card in India.
In the card_type column, we have considered Silver, Signature, Gold and Platinum. and expense type(exp_type) column holds values like Entertainment, Food, Bills, Fuel, Travel and Grocery.
